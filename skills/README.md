# Skills Directory

Contains domain-specific knowledge modules that provide specialized capabilities to agents. Skills are reusable across multiple agents and loaded dynamically based on context.

## Concept

Skills are **knowledge modules** — compact chunks of domain expertise that agents can use. Unlike implants (reasoning patterns), skills provide **specific knowledge** about tools, techniques, and best practices.

## Skill vs Implant — Decision Test

> **Is this domain-specific KNOWLEDGE?** → Skill
> **Is this a domain-agnostic REASONING ALGORITHM?** → Implant

| Criterion | Skill | Implant |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Form** | Reference: Role → Rules → Concepts → Actions | Pattern: step 1 → step 2 → step 3 |
| **Scope** | Specific to ONE domain | Applies to ANY domain |
| **Example** | "SOLID, DRY, KISS" (clean code) | "Draft → Verify → Correct" (CoV) |
| **Teaches** | WHAT to know | HOW to think |
| **Frontmatter** | `compiled` (required), `globs` (optional), Role in description | `short_name`, `one_liner`, `globs: []` |

**Skills CAN reference implants** as "use this reasoning technique here" (e.g., `skill-analysis-critical` points to `implant-chain-of-verification`), but must NOT duplicate implant content.

## Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
---
description: "Brief description with key concepts. Role: Persona."
globs: ["**/*.py", "**/*.ts"]  # File patterns for auto-activation
alwaysApply: false              # Whether to always include
---
## Role
Persona for this skill.

## Rules
- Rule 1
- Rule 2

## Concepts
- **Concept A**: Definition
- **Concept B**: Definition

## Actions
- `action()`: What it does
```

## Loading Methods

### 1. Static Loading

Defined in agent's `static_skills` frontmatter:

```yaml
static_skills:
  - "skill-dev-clean-code.mdc"
  - "skill-dev-debugging.mdc"
```

Used when MCP is unavailable (fallback mode).

### 2. Dynamic Loading (RAG)

Defined in agent's `preferred_skills` frontmatter:

```yaml
preferred_skills:
  - "skill-dev-clean-code"
  - "skill-dev-debugging"
```

MCP server uses ChromaDB to select relevant skills based on:
- Query content
- Agent's preferred skills
- Skill descriptions

### 3. Glob-Based Auto-Loading

Skills with `globs` patterns activate when matching files are in context:

```yaml
globs: ["**/*.py", "**/*.ts"]
```

### 4. Always-Apply

Skills with `alwaysApply: true` are always loaded:

```yaml
alwaysApply: true
```

## Creating a New Skill

1. **Create file**: `skills/skill-domain-name.mdc`

2. **Add content**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: "My Skill: what it provides. Key concepts: A, B, C. Role: Expert."
   globs: ["**/*.ext"]
   alwaysApply: false
   ---
   ## Role
   Expert in Domain: specific expertise.

   ## Rules
   - **Rule 1**: Explanation
   - **Rule 2**: Explanation

   ## Concepts
   - **Concept A**: Definition and usage
   - **Concept B**: Definition and usage

   ## Actions
   - `action_name()`: What this action does
   - `another_action()`: What this does
   ```

3. **Reference in agent**:
   ```yaml
   # In agent's system_prompt.mdc
   static_skills:
     - "skill-domain-name.mdc"
   preferred_skills:
     - "skill-domain-name"
   ```

4. **Restart MCP server**: To re-index skills in ChromaDB

## Best Practices

- **Keep skills focused**: One domain/capability per file
- **Write dense descriptions**: Used for RAG matching
- **Use consistent structure**: Role → Rules → Concepts → Actions
- **Include practical actions**: Callable methods/procedures
- **Avoid overlap**: Skills should be complementary, not redundant
