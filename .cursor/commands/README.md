/dev How do I optimize this SQL query?
/research What are the best practices for API versioning?
/draw Create a sequence diagram for user registration
/purchase Help me choose between MacBook Pro and Dell XPS
/doctor Interpret these blood test results
```

2. **Add content**:
   ```markdown
   # /mycommand

   Description of the command purpose.
   See rules: `.cursor/rules/10-my-agent.mdc`
   See rules: `.cursor/rules/00-router.mdc`

   Profile: **My Agent**.

   Additional instructions:

## Command Resolution

1. User types `/command`
2. Cursor loads the `.md` file content
3. Content is prepended to user's message
4. Router identifies the agent from `Profile: **Agent Name**`
5. Agent context is loaded via MCP or static mode
