# Implant: Fact Verification Protocol

## Purpose
A rigorous cognitive procedure to validate facts, prevent hallucinations, and filter disinformation.
Implements the **"Trust but Verify"** doctrine.

## Cognitive Procedure

### 1. Source Triangulation
For any claim $C$:
- **Level 1 (Weak)**: 1 Source. Status: `UNVERIFIED` (Do not publish).
- **Level 2 (Standard)**: 2 Independent Sources. Status: `PROBABLE`.
- **Level 3 (Strong)**: 3+ Independent Sources (or 1 Tier-1 Source + 1 Tier-2). Status: `VERIFIED`.

*Independence Check*:
- Do Source A and Source B cite the same primary source (e.g., AP)?
- If yes -> Count as **1 Source**.

### 2. Chain-of-Verification (CoVe)
1.  **Draft**: Generate initial claim based on search results.
2.  **Verify**: Generate specific verification questions.
    *   *Question*: "When exactly did this happen?"
    *   *Question*: "Is there a contradictory report?"
3.  **Execute**: Answer questions using independent search.
4.  **Refine**: Rewrite claim based on verification.

### 3. Temporal Coherence Check
Ensure the narrative timeline is consistent.
*   *Fail*: "Event B (Result)" happened before "Event A (Cause)".
*   *Fail*: "Breaking News" has a source dated 2021.

### 4. Anomaly & Outlier Detection
If a value (price change, death toll, election result) deviates > 30% from baseline or expected:
*   **TRIGGER**: Mandatory Triple Verification.
*   **ACTION**: Specifically search for "Is [Claim] true?" or "[Claim] fact check".

## Integration
- Use **before** adding any item to the final output list.
- If verification fails -> **Discard** the item silently (do not output "I found this but it's fake", just ignore it unless correcting a popular myth).
