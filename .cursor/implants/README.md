# Implants Directory

Contains cognitive reasoning strategies ("implants") that augment agent reasoning capabilities. Based on prompt engineering research and advanced reasoning frameworks.

## Concept

Implants are **cognitive patterns** that enhance how agents think and reason. Unlike skills (domain knowledge), implants provide **meta-cognitive strategies** — ways of approaching problems rather than specific knowledge.

description: "Brief description of the reasoning technique"
globs: []              # File patterns for auto-activation (usually empty)

1. Step one of the technique
2. Step two...

## Implant Categories

### Chain-of-Thought Variants

Techniques that structure sequential reasoning:

| Implant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `chain-of-note` | RAG annotation — annotate relevance before synthesis |
| `chain-of-draft` | Iterative drafting for complex outputs |
| `chain-of-symbol` | Symbolic reasoning for logic problems |
| `chain-of-table` | Tabular reasoning for structured data |
| `contrastive-cot` | Compare correct vs incorrect reasoning paths |
| `self-harmonized-cot` | Multiple perspectives harmonized into one |
| `reverse-cot` | Work backwards from conclusion to premises |

### Meta-Cognition

Techniques for self-reflection and improvement:

| Implant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `self-consistency` | Generate multiple answers, select consensus |
| `self-discover` | Discover own reasoning patterns |
| `metacognitive-prompting` | Reflect on thinking process |
| `recursion-of-thought` | Recursive problem decomposition |
| `active-prompting` | Actively select most informative examples |

### Structured Thinking

Techniques for organizing complex reasoning:

| Implant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `skeleton-of-thought` | Outline first, then fill details |
| `graph-of-thoughts` | Non-linear reasoning graphs |
| `layer-of-thoughts` | Hierarchical reasoning layers |
| `thread-of-thought` | Maintain coherent reasoning thread |
| `buffer-of-thoughts` | Working memory management |
| `narrative-of-thought` | Story-based reasoning |

### Verification & Safety

Techniques for ensuring correctness and safety:

| Implant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `fact-verification` | Multi-source fact checking protocol |
| `constitutional-critique` | Ethical review against principles |
| `sandwich-defense` | Injection attack protection |
| `instructional-hierarchy` | Priority of system vs user instructions |
| `negative-constraints` | Explicit "what NOT to do" rules |

### Generation Strategies

Techniques for producing better outputs:

| Implant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `analogical-prompting` | Reasoning by analogy to known cases |
| `generated-knowledge` | Generate context before answering |
| `few-shot-selection` | Dynamic example selection |
| `role-play-expert` | Deep expertise via persona assignment |
| `mega-prompting` | All-in-one comprehensive instruction |
| `directional-stimulus` | Hint-based guidance |
| `emotion-prompting` | Emotional context for engagement |

### Decomposition

Techniques for breaking down complex problems:

| Implant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `least-to-most-prompting` | Solve simpler sub-problems first |
| `complexity-based-prompting` | Order by complexity |
| `contextual-compression` | Compress context to essentials |

## Activation Methods

### 1. Automatic (RAG)

Implants are automatically selected based on query relevance:
- Query is embedded
- ChromaDB returns relevant implants
- Top matches are injected into context

### 2. Explicit via MCP Tool

```python
# Request specific reasoning strategy
get_reasoning_strategy(task_type="debugging")
# Returns: chain-of-code, reflexion

get_reasoning_strategy(task_type="analysis")
# Returns: step-back-prompting, chain-of-verification

get_reasoning_strategy(task_type="creative")
# Returns: analogical-prompting, generated-knowledge

get_reasoning_strategy(task_type="planning")
# Returns: plan-and-solve, skeleton-of-thought
```

### 3. Direct Query

```python
get_relevant_implants(query="How do I debug this race condition?")
# Returns implants relevant to debugging
```

## Creating a New Implant

1. **Create file**: `.cursor/implants/implant-my-technique.mdc`

2. **Add content**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: "My Technique: brief explanation of when and why to use it"
   globs: []
   alwaysApply: false
   ---
   ## Pattern
   1. First step of the technique
   2. Second step
   3. ...

   ## Example (optional)
   Input: "..."
   Process: ...
   Output: "..."
   ```

3. **Restart MCP server**: To re-index implants in ChromaDB

## Best Practices

- **Keep implants atomic**: One technique per file
- **Be explicit**: Clear step-by-step instructions
- **Include examples**: When the pattern is complex
- **Use sparingly**: Too many implants increase context size
