description: "Multi-platform 3D model search, quality assessment, and FDM print optimization"
---

## Purpose
Specialized search and evaluation framework for 3D printable models across all major platforms.

## Core Platforms (Prioritized)

### Tier 1 (Curated, High Quality)
1. **Printables.com** (Prusa)
   - Search URL: `https://www.printables.com/search/models?q=[query]`
   - Best for: Tested models, FDM-optimized
   - Data: Ratings, makes, downloads, license

2. **Thangs.com** (Physna)
   - Search URL: `https://thangs.com/search/[query]`
   - Best for: Semantic/visual search, AI-powered
   - Data: AI-matched results, technical specs

3. **MyMiniFactory.com**
   - Search URL: `https://www.myminifactory.com/search/?query=[query]`
   - Best for: Miniatures, artistic models
   - Data: Designer-verified quality

### Tier 2 (Large Libraries)
4. **Thingiverse.com** (MakerBot)
   - Search URL: `https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=[query]`
   - Best for: Widest selection
   - ⚠️ Variable quality - sort by "Most Makes"

5. **Cults3D.com**
   - Search URL: `https://cults3d.com/en/search?q=[query]`
   - Best for: Premium designs
   - Note: Mix of free/paid

### Tier 3 (Specialized)
6. **GrabCAD.com** - Engineering/CAD models
7. **YouMagine.com** - Open-source focus
8. **PrusaPrinters.org** - Community hub
9. **Maker.World** - Bambu Lab ecosystem
10. **Yeggi.com** - Meta-search aggregator (searches others)

## Search Strategies

### Strategy 1: Site-Specific Web Search
```
site:printables.com [query]
site:thingiverse.com [query]
site:thangs.com [query]
```
Best for: Quick broad coverage via search engines.

### Strategy 2: Aggregator Proxy
```
Search via Yeggi.com: "[query] filetype:stl"
```
Best for: Catching models from smaller platforms.

### Strategy 3: Direct Platform Navigation
If web search fails:
1. Use `browser_navigate` to platform search page
2. Use `browser_snapshot` to extract results
3. Parse table/grid of models

## Quality Metrics

### Printability Indicators (Green Flags)
- ✅ "No supports needed" tag
- ✅ Multiple successful makes (>50)
- ✅ Creator-provided print settings
- ✅ Photos of finished prints (not just renders)
- ✅ Orientation guide
- ✅ Multi-part models with assembly instructions

### Quality Red Flags
- ❌ Rating < 3 stars
- ❌ No makes/downloads (untested)
- ❌ Only renders, no print photos
- ❌ Abandoned (last update >3 years, issues unanswered)
- ❌ Mesh errors reported in comments
- ⚠️ "Needs repair" comments

### FDM-Specific Checks
- **Overhangs**: >60° usually needs supports
- **Bridging**: Gaps >10mm may need tuning
- **Minimum Feature Size**: <0.4mm risky for 0.4mm nozzle
- **Wall Thickness**: <1mm may be fragile

## PQRS Scoring Formula

```python
PQRS = (Printability × 0.4) + (Quality × 0.3) + (Relevance × 0.2) + (Support × 0.1)

# Printability (0-40)
printability = 0
if no_supports_needed: printability += 15
if has_print_photos: printability += 10
if has_settings_guide: printability += 10
if creator_tested: printability += 5

# Quality (0-30)
quality = 0
if rating >= 4.5: quality += 10
elif rating >= 4.0: quality += 7
elif rating >= 3.5: quality += 4

if downloads > 1000: quality += 10
elif downloads > 500: quality += 7
elif downloads > 100: quality += 4

if makes > 100: quality += 10
elif makes > 50: quality += 7
elif makes > 10: quality += 4

# Relevance (0-20)
# Semantic match to query
exact_match: 20
category_match: 15
partial_match: 10
tangential: 5

# Support (0-10)
support = 0
if has_multiple_formats: support += 5  # STL + 3MF + STEP
if license_is_clear: support += 3       # CC-BY, CC0, etc.
if has_documentation: support += 2      # README, instructions
```

## Output Templates

### Compact Result (for lists)
```markdown
**[Model Name]** | PQRS: **XX**/100 | [Platform]
⭐ X.X/5 | 📥 YYY | ✅ ZZ makes | Supports: [Yes/No]
🔗 [link]
```

### Detailed Result (for top 3)
```markdown
### 🥇 [Model Name] (PQRS: XX/100)

**Platform**: [Name]
**Creator**: [Username]
**Stats**: ⭐ X.X/5 | 📥 YYY downloads | ✅ ZZ successful makes

**Files**: STL, 3MF, STEP
**License**: CC-BY 4.0 (✅ Commercial use OK)

**Printability**:
- Supports: Not required (optimized for FDM)
- Est. print time: X hours (@0.2mm, 50mm/s)
- Material: PLA recommended (PETG for strength)

**Gotchas**:
- [Any special notes from creator or community]

**Link**: [URL]
```

## FDM Print Recommendations

### By Category

**Functional Parts** (tools, holders, mounts):
- Material: PETG or ABS (strength, temp resistance)
- Infill: 30-50% (load-bearing)
- Perimeters: 3-4 walls
- Layer height: 0.2-0.3mm (speed over detail)

**Decorative** (figurines, art):
- Material: PLA (easy, good detail)
- Infill: 10-15% (just for support)
- Perimeters: 2-3 walls
- Layer height: 0.12-0.16mm (detail)

**Miniatures** (tabletop gaming):
- Material: PLA or resin (FDM struggles with fine detail)
- Infill: 10%
- Layer height: 0.08-0.12mm (maximum detail)
- Speed: 30mm/s (quality over speed)
- ⚠️ FDM limits: ~0.4mm features, consider resin for <28mm scale

**Prototypes/Drafts**:
- Material: PLA (cheap)
- Infill: 10%
- Layer height: 0.3mm (fast)
- Draft mode settings

## Tool Integration

### Web Search Patterns
```
# Broad search
"[query] 3d model stl"

# Platform-specific
"[query] site:printables.com"
"[query] site:thingiverse.com"

# Quality-filtered
"[query] 3d model tested prints"
"[query] stl no supports"
```

### Browser Navigation Flow
```
1. browser_navigate → https://www.printables.com/search/models?q=[query]
2. browser_snapshot → Extract results grid
3. Parse: titles, ratings, download counts, URLs
4. Rank by PQRS
```

## Troubleshooting

**No Results Found**:
1. Try alternate terms (e.g., "spool rack" vs "filament holder")
2. Broaden category (search "holder" not "phone holder iPhone 14")
3. Check Yeggi.com aggregator
4. Suggest related categories

**All Results Low Quality**:
1. Acknowledge quality gap
2. Recommend best-of-bad options
3. Suggest commissioning custom design (Fiverr, etc.)
4. Offer to search for "close enough" alternatives

**Platform Down/Inaccessible**:
1. Skip that platform gracefully
2. Note in sources which platforms were checked
3. Suggest user check directly later
