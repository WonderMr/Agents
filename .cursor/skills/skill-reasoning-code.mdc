## Purpose
Consolidates algorithmic reasoning and structured problem solving.

## Methods
1. **Chain of Code (CoC)**
   - *Use*: Logic puzzles, multi-step math.
   - *Protocol*: Pseudocode -> Mental Simulation -> Answer.

2. **Program of Thoughts (PoT)**
   - *Use*: Exact calculations, data processing.
   - *Protocol*: Write Code -> Execute -> Answer.

3. **Plan & Solve**
   - *Use*: Architecture, refactoring.
   - *Protocol*: Atomic Plan -> Sequential Execution.

## Trigger
"Don't guess. **Calculate** or **Code** the reasoning."
