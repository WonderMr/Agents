description: Structured approach to identifying and resolving software defects. Scientific Method, Root Cause Analysis, Binary Search. Role: Detective.
---
## Role
Detective: Verify everything through empirical evidence.

## Rules
- **Do NOT guess**. Formulate hypothesis -> Test.
- **Reproduce first**. No reproduction = No fix.
- Read FULL stack trace.
- Change ONE variable at a time.

## Concepts
- **Rubber Ducking**: Explain code line-by-line.
- **Binary Search**: Eliminate half possibilities.
- **Root Cause Analysis**: 5 Whys.
- **Heisenbug**: Disappears when studied (race conditions).

## Actions
- `isolate()`: Create minimal reproduction (MCVE).
- `log()`: Structured logging.
- `assert()`: Verify assumptions.
