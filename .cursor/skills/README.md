# Skills Directory

Contains domain-specific knowledge modules that provide specialized capabilities to agents. Skills are reusable across multiple agents and loaded dynamically based on context.

## Concept

Skills are **knowledge modules** — compact chunks of domain expertise that agents can use. Unlike implants (reasoning patterns), skills provide **specific knowledge** about tools, techniques, and best practices.

## Structure

```
skills/
├── skill-dev-clean-code.mdc
├── skill-dev-debugging.mdc
├── skill-bio-protocols.mdc
├── skill-purchase-research.mdc
├── ... (other skills)
└── README.md
```

## Naming Convention

```
skill-{domain}-{capability}.mdc
```

Examples:
- `skill-dev-debugging.mdc` — Development domain, debugging capability
- `skill-bio-protocols.mdc` — Biology domain, protocols knowledge
- `skill-psy-cbt.mdc` — Psychology domain, CBT techniques

## Frontmatter Schema

```yaml
---
description: "Brief description with key concepts. Role: Persona."
globs: ["**/*.py", "**/*.ts"]  # File patterns for auto-activation
alwaysApply: false              # Whether to always include
---
## Role
Persona for this skill.

## Rules
- Rule 1
- Rule 2

## Concepts
- **Concept A**: Definition
- **Concept B**: Definition

## Actions
- `action()`: What it does
```

## Loading Methods

### 1. Static Loading

Defined in agent's `static_skills` frontmatter:

```yaml
static_skills:
  - "skill-dev-clean-code.mdc"
  - "skill-dev-debugging.mdc"
```

Used when MCP is unavailable (fallback mode).

### 2. Dynamic Loading (RAG)

Defined in agent's `preferred_skills` frontmatter:

```yaml
preferred_skills:
  - "skill-dev-clean-code"
  - "skill-dev-debugging"
```

MCP server uses ChromaDB to select relevant skills based on:
- Query content
- Agent's preferred skills
- Skill descriptions

### 3. Glob-Based Auto-Loading

Skills with `globs` patterns activate when matching files are in context:

```yaml
globs: ["**/*.py", "**/*.ts"]
```

### 4. Always-Apply

Skills with `alwaysApply: true` are always loaded:

```yaml
alwaysApply: true
```

## Creating a New Skill

1. **Create file**: `.cursor/skills/skill-domain-name.mdc`

2. **Add content**:
   ```yaml
   ---
   description: "My Skill: what it provides. Key concepts: A, B, C. Role: Expert."
   globs: ["**/*.ext"]
   alwaysApply: false
   ---
   ## Role
   Expert in Domain: specific expertise.

   ## Rules
   - **Rule 1**: Explanation
   - **Rule 2**: Explanation

   ## Concepts
   - **Concept A**: Definition and usage
   - **Concept B**: Definition and usage

   ## Actions
   - `action_name()`: What this action does
   - `another_action()`: What this does
   ```

3. **Reference in agent**:
   ```yaml
   # In agent's system_prompt.mdc
   static_skills:
     - "skill-domain-name.mdc"
   preferred_skills:
     - "skill-domain-name"
   ```

4. **Restart MCP server**: To re-index skills in ChromaDB

## Best Practices

- **Keep skills focused**: One domain/capability per file
- **Write dense descriptions**: Used for RAG matching
- **Use consistent structure**: Role → Rules → Concepts → Actions
- **Include practical actions**: Callable methods/procedures
- **Avoid overlap**: Skills should be complementary, not redundant
