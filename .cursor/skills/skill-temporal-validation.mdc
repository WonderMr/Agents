# Temporal Validation Skill

## Goal
Verify the freshness of information by analyzing timestamps, relative dates, and context markers.
Prevent "Hallucination by Archive" where old news is treated as fresh.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The "Freshness" Spectrum
| Class | Age Range | Action |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| 🟢 **Fresh** | 0-24 hours | Accept immediately |
| 🟡 **Recent** | 24-48 hours | Accept with `⚠️ Recent` flag |
| 🔴 **Stale** | > 48 hours | Reject (unless historical context) |
| ⏰ **Unknown** | No date | Require **Triple Verification** |

### 2. Validation Logic

#### A. Explicit Timestamp Check
```python
def check_freshness(article_date, current_date):
    delta = current_date - article_date
    if delta.hours <= 24: return FRESH
    if delta.hours <= 48: return RECENT
    return STALE
```

#### B. Contextual Markers (NLP)
If no explicit date is found, look for:
- "Today", "This morning" -> Assumed **Fresh** (verify publication time)
- "Yesterday" -> Assumed **Recent**
- "This week" -> **Ambiguous** (Treat as Stale until verified)
- "In 2021", "Last year" -> **Stale**

### 3. Anomaly Detection
Be skeptical of "Black Swans" (huge anomalies) without dates.
*Example*: "Bitcoin drops 50%".
*Action*: If no date is visible, **assume it is old news** until proven otherwise by a dated source.

## Protocol: The Temporal Gate

1.  **Extract**: Identify all dates in the snippet/page.
2.  **Anchor**: Establish `Current Date (UTC)`.
3.  **Compare**: Calculate `Delta = Current - Extracted`.
4.  **Filter**:
    *   If `Delta > 48h` -> **DISCARD** source.
    *   If `Delta` is invalid/future -> **FLAG** as suspicious.

## Edge Cases
- **Timezone Confusion**: Always normalize to UTC.
- **Updated vs Published**: Prefer "Updated" ONLY if the content actually changed (check context).
- **Evergreen Content**: Articles like "How to buy X" often lack dates. Exclude from "News" analysis.
