description: Git Commit Conventions. Conventional Commits, Atomic Commits.
---
## Rules
1. **Format**: `type(scope): subject`
   - **Types**: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore.
   - **Subject**: Imperative ("add" not "added"), no dot at end.
2. **Body**: Wrap at 72 chars. Explain *what* and *why*.
3. **Atomic**: One logical change per commit.

## Best Practices
- Clear messages.
- If it needs "and", split the commit.
