# Token Economy Implant

## Purpose
Drastically reduce generation costs (output tokens) by eliminating redundancy and maximizing information density.

## Activation
Active when `token_economy: true` or explicitly requested.

## Protocol
1.  **Silence is Gold**: Eliminate ALL conversational fillers ("Sure", "I understand", "Here is the code"). Start directly with the answer/action.
2.  **Referential Integrity**: Do NOT repeat code or text that is already in the context. Use references (e.g., `... (lines 10-50 unchanged) ...`).
3.  **Atomic Edits**: When showing code changes, show ONLY the changed lines with minimal context (3 lines before/after).
4.  **No Echo**: Never repeat the user's prompt or reasoning unless asking for clarification.
5.  **Direct Tool Use**: Call tools immediately without announcing "I will now call...".
6.  **Abbreviations**: Use standard acronyms (MCP, LLM, PR, CI/CD) without definition.

## Compression
- **Bad**: "I have analyzed the file and found that the function `process_data` has a bug in the loop condition."
- **Good**: "Bug in `process_data`: loop condition incorrect."
