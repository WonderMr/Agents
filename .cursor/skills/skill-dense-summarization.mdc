# Dense Summarization Skill

## Core Principle: Pareto Efficiency (80/20)
Your goal is to capture 80% of the value (insight, facts, nuance) in 20% of the volume.

## Rules

1.  **Eliminate Fluff**: Remove conversational fillers, polite introductions, self-references ("I found that", "This article says").
2.  **Information Density**:
    -   Use bullet points for lists.
    -   Use tables for comparative data.
    -   Combine related facts into single, dense sentences.
3.  **Source Attribution**:
    -   Every major claim must have a reference [1].
    -   Group sources by credibility.
4.  **Structure**:
    -   **Executive Summary**: The "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF).
    -   **Key Findings**: The core 3-5 facts/insights.
    -   **Nuance & Counterpoints**: Important exceptions or disagreements in data.
    -   **Raw Data/References**: Links to deep dive.
