# Skill: Purchase Research & Decision Matrix

## Purpose
Provides a structured, quantitative framework for comparing products and making purchase decisions. Optimized for premium (non-luxury) segment where objective comparison reveals best value.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Decision Matrix Framework

A decision matrix converts subjective preferences into objective scores:

```
Final Score = Σ(Weight_i × Score_i) where i = 1 to n criteria
```

**Components**:
- **Criteria**: Measurable or assessable product attributes
- **Weights**: Importance of each criterion (sum = 1.0)
- **Scores**: Product performance on each criterion (0-10 scale)

### 2. Trust-Weighted Sources

Not all information is equally reliable. Apply trust scoring:

| Tier | Trust % | Source Types | Usage |
|------|---------|--------------|-------|
| **Platinum** | 100% | Professional test labs (rtings, notebookcheck, anandtech) | Primary truth for technical specs |
| **Gold** | 85% | Expert communities (4pda, overclock.net, head-fi) | Real-world usage, long-term reliability |
| **Silver** | 70% | Aggregated user reviews (10+ reviews on retail sites) | Common issues, QA problems |
| **Bronze** | 60% | Tech journalism (CNET, Techradar) | Industry context, trends |
| **Copper** | 30% | Marketing materials | Specs only, verify elsewhere |

**Conflict Resolution**: When sources disagree, weight by trust tier. If Platinum contradicts Bronze, trust Platinum.

### 3. Premium vs Luxury Distinction

**Premium Indicators**:
- Engineering excellence (materials, tolerances, R&D)
- Performance advantage (measurable benchmarks)
- Longevity (durability, update support)
- Practical features with real utility

**Luxury Indicators** (deprioritize):
- Brand prestige without performance delta
- Aesthetic excess (gold plating, designer branding)
- Exclusivity as primary value prop
- Diminishing returns (2x price for 10% better)

**Action**: Calculate "value slope" - does each ₽1000 increase deliver proportional benefit?

## Protocol: Step-by-Step

### Step 1: Define Criteria (From User Needs)

Extract criteria from user's must-haves and nice-to-haves:

**Example Mapping**:
- User: "Need headphones for work, noise isolation is important"
- Criteria:
  - ANC Performance (must-have → high weight)
  - Battery Life (work context → medium weight)
  - Microphone Quality (work context → medium weight)
  - Sound Quality (implied → medium weight)
  - Comfort (implied for extended use → medium weight)

**Criteria Types**:
1. **Quantitative**: Benchmarkable (battery mAh, weight grams, response time ms)
2. **Qualitative**: Expert consensus (build quality, ergonomics, software UX)
3. **Binary**: Present/absent (feature checklist)

### Step 2: Assign Weights (Validate with User)

**Initial Weighting Formula**:
- Must-have features: 0.25-0.35 each
- Nice-to-have features: 0.10-0.20 each
- Implicit criteria (durability, value): 0.05-0.15 each

**Validation**:
Present proposed weights to user:
```markdown
## Proposed Criteria Weights
1. ANC Performance: 30% (your top priority)
2. Battery Life: 20%
3. Mic Quality: 20%
4. Sound Quality: 15%
5. Comfort: 10%
6. Value (Price/Performance): 5%

Do you want to adjust priorities?
```

**Adjustment**: Allow user to redistribute ±5-10% between criteria.

### Step 3: Score Products (0-10 Scale)

**Scoring Guidelines**:

**Quantitative Criteria** (use normalization):
```
Score = 10 × (Value - Min) / (Max - Min)
```
Example: Battery life across products: 20h, 30h, 40h
- 20h: 10 × (20-20)/(40-20) = 0
- 30h: 10 × (30-20)/(40-20) = 5
- 40h: 10 × (40-20)/(40-20) = 10

**Qualitative Criteria** (convert expert ratings):
- "Excellent" / 5 stars → 9-10
- "Very Good" / 4 stars → 7-8
- "Good" / 3 stars → 5-6
- "Fair" / 2 stars → 3-4
- "Poor" / 1 star → 0-2

**Binary Criteria** (feature checklist):
- Present: 10
- Absent: 0
- (Or exclude if all products have/lack it)

### Step 4: Calculate Final Scores

Build the matrix:

| Criteria | Weight | Product A | Product B | Product C |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| ANC Performance | 0.30 | 8 (2.4) | 9 (2.7) | 7 (2.1) |
| Battery Life | 0.20 | 6 (1.2) | 8 (1.6) | 10 (2.0) |
| Mic Quality | 0.20 | 7 (1.4) | 9 (1.8) | 6 (1.2) |
| Sound Quality | 0.15 | 9 (1.35) | 7 (1.05) | 8 (1.2) |
| Comfort | 0.10 | 8 (0.8) | 7 (0.7) | 9 (0.9) |
| Value | 0.05 | 5 (0.25) | 7 (0.35) | 6 (0.3) |
| **TOTAL** | **1.00** | **7.4** | **8.2** | **7.7** |

**Interpretation**:
- Product B wins (8.2)
- Gap to #2 (Product C): 0.5 points → significant lead
- Gap to #3 (Product A): 0.8 points → clear differentiation

### Step 5: Rank and Recommend

**Output Structure**:

1. **Winner Declaration**:
   ```markdown
   🥇 **[Product B Name]** (8.2/10)
   Best choice for your needs
   ```

2. **Rationale** (tie to user needs):
   ```markdown
   **Why it leads**: Excels in key criteria (ANC, microphone),
   which are critical for your use case (work). Falls behind Product C
   in battery life, but the gap is offset by fast charging.
   ```

3. **Trade-off Analysis**:
   ```markdown
   **Trade-offs**:
   - Battery: 30h vs 40h for Product C (but sufficient for workday)
   - Price: $50 more expensive, but ANC gap justifies it for frequent calls
   ```

4. **Runner-up Scenario**:
   ```markdown
   **Alternative**: Product C
   **When to choose**: If battery life is more important than ANC (long flights without charging)
   ```

## Advanced Techniques

### Sensitivity Analysis

Test robustness of decision by adjusting weights ±10%:
- If winner changes, recommendation is **fragile** → present both options
- If winner stable, recommendation is **robust** → confident choice

### Diminishing Returns Detection

For each price tier increase, calculate marginal benefit:
```
Marginal Value = (Score_higher - Score_lower) / (Price_higher - Price_lower)
```

**Rule**: Recommend lower tier if marginal value < 0.5 points per ₽1000.

### Long-term Value Projection

Adjust score for longevity factors:
```
Adjusted Score = Raw Score × (1 + Longevity Bonus)
```

**Longevity Bonus**:
- +0.2: Excellent build, 5+ years expected lifespan
- +0.1: Good build, 3-5 years expected lifespan
- 0.0: Average build, 2-3 years expected lifespan
- -0.1: Questionable build, reliability concerns

## Common Pitfalls (Avoid)

1. **Over-weighting Price**: Value is holistic, not just cheapest. Use "value" criterion, not raw price.
2. **Feature Bloat Bias**: Having 50 features doesn't mean 10/10 if user needs only 5.
3. **Halo Effect**: Don't let one excellent criterion inflate others (segment your scoring).
4. **Recency Bias**: Newest ≠ Best. Previous-gen at -30% price often wins on value.
5. **Review Manipulation**: Single outlier reviews (too positive/negative) → trust aggregates.

## Example Output (Abbreviated)

**Query**: "Gaming headset, under $250, need good microphone"

**Matrix**:
| Criteria | Wt | SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro | HyperX Cloud III | Razer BlackShark V2 Pro |
|----------|----|-----------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| Mic Quality | 0.35 | 9 (3.15) | 8 (2.8) | 7 (2.45) |
| Sound | 0.25 | 8 (2.0) | 9 (2.25) | 8 (2.0) |
| Comfort | 0.20 | 7 (1.4) | 9 (1.8) | 8 (1.6) |
| Build | 0.15 | 9 (1.35) | 8 (1.2) | 7 (1.05) |
| Value | 0.05 | 6 (0.3) | 8 (0.4) | 7 (0.35) |
| **Total** | 1.0 | **8.2** | **8.45** | **7.45** |

**Recommendation**: HyperX Cloud III (8.45) wins despite lower mic rating because gap is small (8 vs 9) while it dominates on comfort (critical for long gaming sessions). Trade-off: SteelSeries has slightly better mic but less comfortable. Runner-up: SteelSeries if streaming/communication > gaming duration.
