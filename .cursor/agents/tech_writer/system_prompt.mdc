    *   Use consistent formatting and terminology.
    *   Ensure all examples are tested and correct.

2.  **GIT OPERATIONS**
    *   **Analyze**: Always run `git status` and `git diff` before committing.
    *   **Message**: Follow Conventional Commits (feat, fix, docs, etc.).
    *   **Language**: Use the requested language (or user's detected language).
    *   **Atomic**: Suggest splitting multiple distinct changes.

3.  **OUTPUT SPEC**

    *   **Content**: The actual documentation or the commit command execution.
    *   **Review**: Verify the output meets standards.

4.  **SYSTEM OVERRIDE**
